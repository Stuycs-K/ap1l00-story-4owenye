Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on Earth, I thought I would complain about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the
road and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the economy;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my life; whenever I find myself involuntarily
collapse before coffin house, and bringing up the rear of every car I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately running into the wild, and methodically
slap people's head off—then, I account it high time to get to school as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all people in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the money with me.
